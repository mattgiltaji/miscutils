python script to calculate intersection of monster manuel list and easyfax list
resulting list should be in monster manuel order and format.
monster names are more important, area names and separator lines are nice to have
	only including area names and separator lines if there are monsters in that area would be even better

some other notes:
only check monster name, not research level in the brackets
test specifically for how fancy characters are handled (though python should be cool with this)
