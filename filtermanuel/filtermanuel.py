# This script is intended to filter a file by lines contained in another
# This is as trivial as it sounds; we need to maintain insertion order
# More practically (in terms of Kingdom of Loathing):
#   Take the output from a monster manuel status utility
#   Find the matching monsters in a faxbot list
#   Output the list of matches (in manuel order) into an output file
#   We would also like to preserve area headings from manuel in the output
